# Midnight Darks (SK) Visual Studio Theme

âš« **Midnight Deep** is a fork of my other theme ðŸŒŒ **Midnight Lights** available [here](https://github.com/austinstanding/midnight-lights-vstheme). This aims to be a true dark theme for Visual Studio 2019 and 2022.

> This theme was born out of a need for darkness; to rest my eyes after an extended period of working long hours and feeling like all the other dark themes just weren't dark enough. This aims to be that dark theme. Midnight Deep draws from the palette of Midnight Lights, while providing a true hex #000000 background and lower brightness generally. This won't be for everyone or every occasion, but my vision is to provide an after hours theme that will let your eyes find rest even when you can't.

So now my (eprofservices) fork was born because I had to make some minor modifications to make the theme usable (for me). It is strange but the original theme looks quite different comparing to the above picture, at least on my screen. 

The modifications are an ongoing work, so don't expect it to be the final version (which is why the default branch is develop). It still needs a lot of improvements like syntax highliting redesign, but now at least I can look at the screen without a pain.


## Installation

The only method to install (my fork) at the moment is to 'git clone' it to Visual Studio with necessary addons installed, open the .vstheme file and press Apply button. If you don't have such button or the file is opened by default as xml then you don't have probably all the necessary addons installed (don't ask me which addons have to be installed because I just don't know :).
You have to (probably) have also base theme installed as well (the base theme is "MidnightLights") because as far as I understand the base theme is something like base class and the inherited theme is something like inherited class then it seems to be clear that you cannot compile inherited class if you don't have base class.


## Release Notes
